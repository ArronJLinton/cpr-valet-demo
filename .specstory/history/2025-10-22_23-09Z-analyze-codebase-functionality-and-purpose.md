Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's what this project is and what it's for:

## **CPR CRM Application - Trash Valet & Janitorial Services**

### **What it is:**
This is a **React Native/Expo mobile application** designed as a comprehensive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for **Trash Valet and Janitorial services** called "CPR". It's currently in the **early planning and setup phase** with minimal implementation.

### **What it's for:**
The application serves three main user types in the property services industry:

1. **Employees** - Field workers who perform trash valet and janitorial services
2. **Vendors** - Service providers who manage employees and properties  
3. **Property Managers** - Clients who need service verification and reporting

### **Core Functionality (Planned):**

**ðŸŽ¯ MVP Features (Priority 1):**
- **Geolocation-based time tracking** - Employees clock in/out only when within designated property zones
- **Photo/video proof documentation** - Employees upload media with automatic timestamp, date, and location metadata

**ðŸ“‹ Additional Features (Priority 2-3):**
- **Violation reporting** - Employees report issues with photos and violation type selection
- **Multi-user portals** - Separate dashboards for employees, vendors, and property managers
- **Automated reporting** - System generates and distributes reports to relevant parties
- **Multi-language support** - English and Spanish interface
- **Communication system** - Direct messaging between users

### **Current Implementation Status:**

**âœ… Completed:**
- Basic Expo/React Native project setup with TypeScript
- Project structure and documentation planning
- App configuration with required permissions (camera, location, media library)
- Basic tab navigation structure

**ðŸš§ In Progress:**
- Only the foundational setup phase is complete
- The actual business logic and features are **not yet implemented**
- Currently shows placeholder "Tab One" and "Tab Two" screens

**ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:**
The project is ready to begin **Phase 2 (Foundational)** which includes:
- Database setup with Expo SQLite
- Permission utilities
- Location services
- Core TypeScript interfaces
- Navigation structure

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Framework:** React Native with Expo SDK 54
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.9.2
- **Database:** Expo SQLite (local storage)
- **Maps:** React Native Maps
- **Camera:** Expo Camera
- **Location:** Expo Location
- **Testing:** Jest, React Native Testing Library

### **Business Purpose:**
This application addresses the need for **service verification and accountability** in the property services industry by:
- Ensuring employees are actually at the correct property when clocking in/out
- Providing photo/video proof of completed work
- Automating report generation for clients
- Enabling real-time communication between all parties
- Supporting multiple languages for diverse workforces

The project is essentially a **field service management system** specifically tailored for trash valet and janitorial services, with a focus on location-based verification and proof documentation.
