## User Input

```text
, I want this codebase to be written in a way tha tis simple and easy to understand for new developers.
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     * MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     * MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     * PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:
- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you create a project constitution that emphasizes simplicity and ease of understanding for new developers. Let me start by examining the existing constitution template and the project structure.

Now I have a good understanding of the project structure. This is a React Native/Expo project called "trash-valet-demo" that appears to be a mobile application. Based on the user's request for simplicity and ease of understanding for new developers, I'll create a constitution that emphasizes:

1. Clear, readable code
2. Comprehensive documentation
3. Simple architecture
4. TypeScript usage (as per user memory)
5. Testing and quality practices

Let me create the updated constitution:

- [PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
- <!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->
- 
- ### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
- <!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->

- 
- ### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
- <!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->

- <!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->
- 
- ### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
- <!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->

- ## [SECTION_3_NAME]
- <!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->
- 
- [SECTION_3_CONTENT]
- <!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->
+ ### I. Simplicity First
+ Code MUST be written for human readability over cleverness. Every component, function, and file should be immediately understandable to a new developer within 5 minutes. Complex logic MUST be broken into smaller, well-named functions. Abstractions are only allowed when they demonstrably reduce complexity, not add it.
+ 
+ ### II. TypeScript Everywhere
+ All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. No `any` types allowed without explicit justification. Interfaces and types MUST be defined for all data structures. This ensures compile-time safety and serves as living documentation for new developers.
+ 
+ ### III. Component-Driven Development
+ React components MUST be small, focused, and reusable. Each component should have a single responsibility. Props interfaces MUST be clearly defined. Components MUST be organized in a logical folder structure that mirrors the application's information architecture.
+ 
+ ### IV. Documentation as Code
+ Every public function, component, and complex logic block MUST have JSDoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return values. README files MUST exist for each major feature area. Code examples MUST be provided for complex usage patterns.
+ 
+ ### V. Test-Driven Quality
+ Critical user flows MUST have integration tests. Complex business logic MUST have unit tests. All tests MUST be written in plain language that describes the expected behavior. Test files MUST be co-located with the code they test.
+ 
+ ## Development Standards
+ 
+ ### Code Organization
+ - Use feature-based folder structure over technical layers
+ - Keep related files together (component, styles, tests, types)
+ - Maximum 3 levels of folder nesting
+ - Use index files for clean imports
+ 
+ ### Naming Conventions
+ - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)
+ - Functions: camelCase with descriptive verbs (e.g., `validateUserInput`)
+ - Files: kebab-case for components, camelCase for utilities
+ - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
+ 
+ ### Performance Guidelines
+ - Use React.memo for expensive components
+ - Implement proper key props for lists
+ - Lazy load screens and heavy components
+ - Optimize images and assets
+ 
+ ## Quality Assurance
+ 
+ ### Code Review Requirements
+ - All code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
+ - Reviews MUST focus on readability and maintainability
+ - Complex logic MUST include inline comments explaining the "why"
+ - New dependencies MUST be justified and documented
+ 
+ ### Testing Standards
+ - Integration tests for user journeys
+ - Unit tests for business logic
+ - Visual regression tests for UI components
+ - All tests MUST be deterministic and fast
  
  ## Governance
- <!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->
- 
- [GOVERNANCE_RULES]
- <!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
- 
- **Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
- <!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
- 
+ 
+ This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
+ 1. Documentation of the proposed change
+ 2. Team discussion and consensus
+ 3. Update to this constitution file
+ 4. Migration plan for existing code
+ 
+ All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity additions MUST be justified with clear reasoning. Use this constitution as the primary guidance for all development decisions.
+ 
+ **Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-01-27 | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-27

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've accomplished:

## Summary

I've successfully created and updated the project constitution for the Trash Valet Demo codebase with a focus on simplicity and ease of understanding for new developers. Here's what was accomplished:

### New Constitution (v1.0.0)
Created a comprehensive constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with five core principles:

1. **Simplicity First** - Code must be immediately understandable to new developers
2. **TypeScript Everywhere** - Strict typing for all code with no `any` types
3. **Component-Driven Development** - Small, focused, reusable React components
4. **Documentation as Code** - JSDoc comments and clear documentation requirements
5. **Test-Driven Quality** - Mandatory testing for critical flows and complex logic

### Updated Templates
✅ **plan-template.md** - Added constitution compliance checks for all five principles
✅ **spec-template.md** - Enhanced user story guidance to emphasize plain language and simplicity
✅ **tasks-template.md** - Made testing mandatory and aligned with constitution principles

### Key Features of the Constitution
- **Developer-friendly**: Every principle focuses on making code accessible to new team members
- **TypeScript-focused**: Aligns with your preference for TypeScript [[memory:4151959]]
- **React Native/Expo optimized**: Tailored for the mobile app structure
- **Clear governance**: Defined amendment process and compliance requirements
- **Practical guidelines**: Specific naming conventions, folder structure, and quality standards

### Suggested Commit Message
```
docs: establish constitution v1.0.0 (simplicity-first development principles)

- Add core principles: Simplicity First, TypeScript Everywhere, Component-Driven Development
- Mandate Documentation as Code and Test-Driven Quality
- Update all templates to enforce constitution compliance
- Establish governance and amendment procedures
```

The constitution is now ready to guide development practices that will make the codebase simple and easy to understand for new developers joining the project.

## User Input

```text
we are looking to build CRM application for Trash Valet and Janatorial services called CPR. The core requirements for the application are below:
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `we are looking to build CRM application for Trash Valet and Janatorial services called CPR. The core requirements for the application are below:` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "we are looking to build CRM application for Trash Valet and Janatorial services called CPR. The core requirements for the application are below:"` from repo root **with the short-name argument** and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.

   **IMPORTANT**:

   - Append the short-name argument to the `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "we are looking to build CRM application for Trash Valet and Janatorial services called CPR. The core requirements for the application are below:"` command with the 2-4 word short name you created in step 1
   - Bash: `--short-name "your-generated-short-name"`
   - PowerShell: `-ShortName "your-generated-short-name"`
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")
   - You must only ever run this script once
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for

3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```
   
   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)
   
   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
      
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
      
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
      
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:
        
           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```
        
        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved
   
   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)
   
**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

  ## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_
  
- <!--
-   IMPORTANT: Following the "Simplicity First" principle, user stories must be written in plain language
-   that any developer can understand immediately. Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE
-   - meaning if you implement just ONE of them, you should still have a viable MVP that delivers value.
- 
-   Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
-   Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
-   - Developed independently
-   - Tested independently
-   - Deployed independently
-   - Demonstrated to users independently
- 
-   Each story should be simple enough for a new developer to understand and implement.
- -->
- 
- ### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)
- 
- [Describe this user journey in plain language]
+ ### User Story 1 - Employee Time Tracking (Priority: P1)
+ 
+ An employee arrives at a property and needs to clock in to start their shift, then clock out when finished. The system must verify they are within the designated property zone and record their exact location and time.
+ 
+ **Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables payroll tracking and service verification. Without accurate time tracking, the entire business model fails.
+ 
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee attempt to clock in/out at various locations and verifying the system only allows it within designated property zones.
+ 
+ **Acceptance Scenarios**:
+ 
+ 1. **Given** an employee is within a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock in, **Then** the system records their arrival time, location, and date
+ 2. **Given** an employee is outside a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock in, **Then** the system prevents clock-in and shows an error message
+ 3. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they attempt to clock out, **Then** the system records their departure time, location, and date
+ 4. **Given** an employee is outside a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock out, **Then** the system prevents clock-out and shows an error message
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### User Story 2 - Service Proof Documentation (Priority: P1)
+ 
+ An employee completes service work and needs to upload photos or videos as proof of service completion, including timestamp, date, and location metadata.
+ 
+ **Why this priority**: Service verification is critical for billing, quality assurance, and dispute resolution. This directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.
+ 
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee upload various media files and verifying all metadata is correctly captured and stored.
+ 
+ **Acceptance Scenarios**:
+ 
+ 1. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they take a photo during their shift, **Then** the system automatically captures timestamp, date, and location
+ 2. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they record a video during their shift, **Then** the system automatically captures timestamp, date, and location
+ 3. **Given** an employee uploads media, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the system stores the file with all metadata for service verification
+ 4. **Given** an employee is not clocked in, **When** they attempt to upload media, **Then** the system prevents upload and shows an error message
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### User Story 3 - Violation Reporting (Priority: P2)
+ 
+ An employee encounters a violation or issue at a property and needs to report it with photos and specific violation type selection.
  
- **Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]
- 
- **Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]
+ **Why this priority**: Violation reporting enables proactive issue resolution and maintains service quality standards. It's essential for client relationship management.
+ 
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee report various violation types and verifying the system generates proper reports and notifications.
  
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  
- 1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
- 2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
+ 1. **Given** an employee encounters a violation, **When** they select a violation type from the dropdown, **Then** the system allows them to upload photos and submit the report
+ 2. **Given** an employee submits a violation report, **When** the report is processed, **Then** the system automatically generates and sends reports to property and operations managers
+ 3. **Given** a violation report is submitted, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the violation type and photos are included in the automated report
+ 4. **Given** different clients have different violation types, **When** an employee selects violation type, **Then** the system shows only the relevant options for that client
  
  ---
  
- ### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)
+ ### User Story 4 - Vendor Property Management (Priority: P2)
  
- [Describe this user journey in plain language]
+ A vendor needs to assign employees to properties, review proof uploads, and communicate with both employees and property managers.
  
- **Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]
+ **Why this priority**: Vendors are the operational managers who coordinate service delivery. Their ability to manage assignments and review work is essential for business operations.
  
- **Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a vendor assign employees, review uploaded proof, and send messages to verify the workflow functions correctly.
  
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  
- 1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
+ 1. **Given** a vendor has access to the system, **When** they assign an employee to a property, **Then** the employee can clock in/out at that property
+ 2. **Given** an employee has uploaded proof of service, **When** a vendor reviews the dashboard, **Then** they can see all uploaded photos/videos with timestamps and locations
+ 3. **Given** a vendor needs to communicate, **When** they send a message to an employee or property manager, **Then** the recipient receives the message in their portal
+ 4. **Given** violation reports are generated, **When** a vendor checks their dashboard, **Then** they can see automated violation and performance reports
  
  ---
  
- ### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)
+ ### User Story 5 - Property Manager Client Portal (Priority: P3)
  
- [Describe this user journey in plain language]
+ A property manager needs to view property reports, proof of service, violations, upload tenant lists, and communicate with the operations team.
  
- **Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]
+ **Why this priority**: Property managers are the clients who need visibility into service delivery and the ability to manage their properties. This supports client retention and satisfaction.
  
- **Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a property manager upload tenant lists, view reports, and communicate with operations to verify the client portal functionality.
  
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  
- 1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
- 
- ---
- 
- [Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]
+ 1. **Given** a property manager has access to their portal, **When** they view property reports, **Then** they can see proof of service, violations, and performance metrics
+ 2. **Given** a property manager has a tenant list, **When** they upload a CSV file, **Then** the system processes the list and enables automated report distribution
+ 3. **Given** violation reports are generated for their property, **When** a property manager checks their portal, **Then** they receive automated email reports
+ 4. **Given** a property manager needs to communicate, **When** they send a message to the operations team, **Then** the operations team receives the message
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### User Story 6 - Multi-Language Support (Priority: P3)
+ 
+ Users need to access the application in English or Spanish, with language automatically applied during signup and the option to add French in the future.
+ 
+ **Why this priority**: Multi-language support is essential for diverse workforces and ensures all users can effectively use the system regardless of their primary language.
+ 
+ **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having users sign up in different languages and verifying the interface displays correctly in their selected language.
+ 
+ **Acceptance Scenarios**:
+ 
+ 1. **Given** a user signs up for the system, **When** they select their preferred language, **Then** the entire interface displays in that language
+ 2. **Given** the system supports English and Spanish, **When** a user switches languages, **Then** all text, labels, and messages update to the selected language
+ 3. **Given** the system needs to support French in the future, **When** French is added, **Then** users can select French as their language option
+ 4. **Given** automated reports are generated, **When** they are sent to users, **Then** the reports are in the user's preferred language

## Specification Complete! ✅

I've successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for the CPR CRM application. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📋 **Specification Summary**

**Branch**: `001-cpr-crm-app`  
**Spec File**: `/Users/arronlinton/Desktop/MagistriDev/cpr/trash-valet-demo/specs/001-cpr-crm-app/spec.md`  
**Checklist**: `/Users/arronlinton/Desktop/MagistriDev/cpr/trash-valet-demo/specs/001-cpr-crm-app/checklists/requirements.md`

### 🎯 **Key Features Specified**

1. **Employee Time Tracking** (P1) - Geofenced clock in/out with location verification
2. **Service Proof Documentation** (P1) - Photo/video uploads with automatic metadata capture
3. **Violation Reporting** (P2) - Dynamic forms with automated report generation
4. **Vendor Property Management** (P2) - Employee assignment and proof review
5. **Property Manager Portal** (P3) - Client dashboard with tenant management
6. **Multi-Language Support** (P3) - English/Spanish with future French support

### ✅ **Quality Validation Results**

**All checklist items PASSED:**
- ✅ No implementation details (technology-agnostic)
- ✅ Focused on user value and business needs
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Complete acceptance scenarios and edge cases identified
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required

### 🚀 **Ready for Next Phase**

The specification is **ready for `/speckit.plan`** command. The spec includes:

- **6 User Stories** with clear priorities and independent testing scenarios
- **15 Functional Requirements** covering all core features
- **8 Key Entities** defining the data model
- **10 Measurable Success Criteria** with specific performance targets
- **7 Edge Cases** for comprehensive testing coverage

The specification follows the "Simplicity First" principle from your constitution, ensuring new developers can easily understand and implement each feature independently.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       * A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       * A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
   - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
   - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
   - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
   - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
   - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions:
       * **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
          - Best practices for the project type
          - Common patterns in similar implementations
          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
       * Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
       * Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
       * Then render all options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E as needed up to 5)
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)

       * After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):
       * Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
       * Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
       * Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
    - After the user answers:
       * If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
       * Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       * Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       * User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
       * You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
   - Number of questions asked & answered.
   - Path to updated spec.
   - Sections touched (list names).
   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.
   - Suggested next command.

Behavior rules:
- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
 - If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
 - If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

Now I'll perform a structured ambiguity and coverage scan across the taxonomy categories to identify areas needing clarification.

## Coverage Analysis

**Functional Scope & Behavior**: Clear - Well-defined user roles, clear success criteria, explicit scope boundaries

**Domain & Data Model**: Clear - Entities well-defined with relationships, identity rules clear

**Interaction & UX Flow**: Clear - Critical user journeys well-mapped, error states identified

**Non-Functional Quality Attributes**: Clear - Performance targets specified, scalability limits defined

**Integration & External Dependencies**: Partial - Missing specific details about external services

**Edge Cases & Failure Handling**: Clear - Comprehensive edge cases identified

**Constraints & Tradeoffs**: Clear - Technical constraints implied through success criteria

**Terminology & Consistency**: Clear - Consistent terminology throughout

**Completion Signals**: Clear - Testable acceptance criteria, measurable outcomes

**Misc / Placeholders**: Clear - No TODO markers or ambiguous language

Based on this analysis, I found only one area that needs clarification:

## Question 1: External Service Dependencies

**Context**: The specification mentions automated email reports and CSV processing but doesn't specify how these external integrations should be handled.

**What we need to know**: How should the system handle external service failures (email delivery, file processing)?

**Recommended:** Option A - This provides the most robust approach for a business-critical CRM system where report delivery is essential for operations.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Retry failed operations with exponential backoff, queue for manual retry, and alert administrators |
| B | Fail silently and log errors for later investigation |
| C | Block user operations until external services are restored |
| Short | Provide a different approach (<=5 words) |

You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.

+ - **Alternative Considered**: Redux Toolkit (rejected due to complexity)
+ 
+ ### Database
+ - **Decision**: Expo SQLite for local storage
+ - **Rationale**: Offline-first approach, good performance, familiar SQL interface
+ - **Alternative Considered**: AsyncStorage (insufficient for complex queries)
+ 
+ ### Navigation
+ - **Decision**: React Navigation v6 with bottom tabs
+ - **Rationale**: Industry standard, excellent TypeScript support, good performance
+ - **Alternative Considered**: Native navigation (more complex setup)
+ 
+ ### Media Storage
+ - **Decision**: Local file system with cloud sync capability
+ - **Rationale**: Offline access, fast loading, cost-effective
+ - **Alternative Considered**: Direct cloud storage (requires constant internet)
+ 
+ ## Risk Mitigation
+ 
+ ### Technical Risks
+ - **GPS Accuracy Issues**: Implement multiple location sources, fallback to manual entry
+ - **Media Upload Failures**: Add retry logic, offline queuing, progress indicators
+ - **Performance on Older Devices**: Optimize images, implement lazy loading, memory management
+ 
+ ### Business Risks
+ - **User Adoption**: Focus on intuitive UI, comprehensive testing, user feedback
+ - **Data Security**: Implement encryption, secure storage, access controls
+ - **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling, efficient database queries
+ 
+ ## Success Metrics
+ 
+ - **Development**: 95% test coverage, <5% bug rate in production
+ - **Performance**: <3s app startup, 60fps UI, <1s navigation
+ - **User Experience**: 90% task completion rate, <2% crash rate
+ - **Business**: 100 concurrent users supported, 99.5% uptime
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ 1. **Immediate**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate detailed task breakdown
+ 2. **Week 1**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with dependency setup
+ 3. **Ongoing**: Regular code reviews and testing at each phase
+ 4. **Final**: Demo preparation and deployment planning
+ 
+ This plan ensures the CPR CRM application will be built following the constitution's principles while delivering all specified features in a maintainable, scalable architecture.

---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)
   
2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase
   
3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase
   
4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
