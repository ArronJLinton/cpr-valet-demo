**Feature Branch**: `001-cpr-crm-app`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we are looking to build CRM application for Trash Valet and Janatorial services called CPR. The core requirements for the application are below:"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should the system handle external service failures (email delivery, file processing)? â†’ A: Retry failed operations with exponential backoff, queue for manual retry, and alert administrators

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Employee Time Tracking (Priority: P1)

An employee arrives at a property and needs to clock in to start their shift, then clock out when finished. The system must verify they are within the designated property zone and record their exact location and time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables payroll tracking and service verification. Without accurate time tracking, the entire business model fails.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee attempt to clock in/out at various locations and verifying the system only allows it within designated property zones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee is within a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock in, **Then** the system records their arrival time, location, and date
2. **Given** an employee is outside a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock in, **Then** the system prevents clock-in and shows an error message
3. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they attempt to clock out, **Then** the system records their departure time, location, and date
4. **Given** an employee is outside a designated property zone, **When** they attempt to clock out, **Then** the system prevents clock-out and shows an error message

### User Story 2 - Service Proof Documentation (Priority: P1)

An employee completes service work and needs to upload photos or videos as proof of service completion, including timestamp, date, and location metadata.

**Why this priority**: Service verification is critical for billing, quality assurance, and dispute resolution. This directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee upload various media files and verifying all metadata is correctly captured and stored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they take a photo during their shift, **Then** the system automatically captures timestamp, date, and location
2. **Given** an employee has clocked in, **When** they record a video during their shift, **Then** the system automatically captures timestamp, date, and location
3. **Given** an employee uploads media, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the system stores the file with all metadata for service verification
4. **Given** an employee is not clocked in, **When** they attempt to upload media, **Then** the system prevents upload and shows an error message

### User Story 3 - Violation Reporting (Priority: P2)

An employee encounters a violation or issue at a property and needs to report it with photos and specific violation type selection.

**Why this priority**: Violation reporting enables proactive issue resolution and maintains service quality standards. It's essential for client relationship management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an employee report various violation types and verifying the system generates proper reports and notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an employee encounters a violation, **When** they select a violation type from the dropdown, **Then** the system allows them to upload photos and submit the report
2. **Given** an employee submits a violation report, **When** the report is processed, **Then** the system automatically generates and sends reports to property and operations managers
3. **Given** a violation report is submitted, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the violation type and photos are included in the automated report
4. **Given** different clients have different violation types, **When** an employee selects violation type, **Then** the system shows only the relevant options for that client

---

### User Story 4 - Vendor Property Management (Priority: P2)

A vendor needs to assign employees to properties, review proof uploads, and communicate with both employees and property managers.

**Why this priority**: Vendors are the operational managers who coordinate service delivery. Their ability to manage assignments and review work is essential for business operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a vendor assign employees, review uploaded proof, and send messages to verify the workflow functions correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a vendor has access to the system, **When** they assign an employee to a property, **Then** the employee can clock in/out at that property
2. **Given** an employee has uploaded proof of service, **When** a vendor reviews the dashboard, **Then** they can see all uploaded photos/videos with timestamps and locations
3. **Given** a vendor needs to communicate, **When** they send a message to an employee or property manager, **Then** the recipient receives the message in their portal
4. **Given** violation reports are generated, **When** a vendor checks their dashboard, **Then** they can see automated violation and performance reports

---

### User Story 5 - Property Manager Client Portal (Priority: P3)

A property manager needs to view property reports, proof of service, violations, upload tenant lists, and communicate with the operations team.

**Why this priority**: Property managers are the clients who need visibility into service delivery and the ability to manage their properties. This supports client retention and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a property manager upload tenant lists, view reports, and communicate with operations to verify the client portal functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a property manager has access to their portal, **When** they view property reports, **Then** they can see proof of service, violations, and performance metrics
2. **Given** a property manager has a tenant list, **When** they upload a CSV file, **Then** the system processes the list and enables automated report distribution
3. **Given** violation reports are generated for their property, **When** a property manager checks their portal, **Then** they receive automated email reports
4. **Given** a property manager needs to communicate, **When** they send a message to the operations team, **Then** the operations team receives the message

---

### User Story 6 - Multi-Language Support (Priority: P3)

Users need to access the application in English or Spanish, with language automatically applied during signup and the option to add French in the future.

**Why this priority**: Multi-language support is essential for diverse workforces and ensures all users can effectively use the system regardless of their primary language.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having users sign up in different languages and verifying the interface displays correctly in their selected language.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user signs up for the system, **When** they select their preferred language, **Then** the entire interface displays in that language
2. **Given** the system supports English and Spanish, **When** a user switches languages, **Then** all text, labels, and messages update to the selected language
3. **Given** the system needs to support French in the future, **When** French is added, **Then** users can select French as their language option
4. **Given** automated reports are generated, **When** they are sent to users, **Then** the reports are in the user's preferred language

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an employee's GPS signal is weak or unavailable during clock in/out?
- How does the system handle multiple employees trying to clock in/out simultaneously at the same property?
- What happens when media upload fails due to poor network connectivity?
- How does the system handle violation reports when the dropdown list is empty or corrupted?
